Running Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) on expresson data for a set of samples using the MSIGDB Cancer Hallmarks

# Heatmap of GSVA results
Using package ComplexHeatmap to create a nice heatmap output for GSVA enrichment scores. Optional: add annotation to samples alongside of heatmap, see R markdon.
